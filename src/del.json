				"description": "Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer–but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code–of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.",

				"description": "Get the most out of JavaScript for building web applications through a series of patterns, techniques, and case studies for clean coding Key FeaturesWrite maintainable JS code using internal abstraction, well-written tests, and well-documented codeUnderstand the agents of clean coding like SOLID principles, OOP, and functional programmingExplore solutions to tackle common JavaScript challenges in building UIs, managing APIs, and writing statesBook Description Building robust apps starts with creating clean code. In this book, you’ll explore techniques for doing this by learning everything from the basics of JavaScript through to the practices of clean code. You’ll write functional, intuitive, and maintainable code while also understanding how your code affects the end user and the wider community. The book starts with popular clean-coding principles such as SOLID, and the Law of Demeter (LoD), along with highlighting the enemies of writing clean code such as cargo culting and over-management. You’ll then delve into JavaScript, understanding the more complex aspects of the language. Next, you’ll create meaningful abstractions using design patterns, such as the Class Pattern and the Revealing Module Pattern. You’ll explore real-world challenges such as DOM reconciliation, state management, dependency management, and security, both within browser and server environments. Later, you’ll cover tooling and testing methodologies and the importance of documenting code. Finally, the book will focus on advocacy and good communication for improving code cleanliness within teams or workplaces, along with covering a case study for clean coding. By the end of this book, you’ll be well-versed with JavaScript and have learned how to create clean abstractions, test them, and communicate about them via documentation. What you will learnUnderstand the true purpose of code and the problems it solves for your end-users and colleaguesDiscover the tenets and enemies of clean code considering the effects of cultural and syntactic conventionsUse modern JavaScript syntax and design patterns to craft intuitive abstractionsMaintain code quality within your team via wise adoption of tooling and advocating best practicesLearn the modern ecosystem of JavaScript and its challenges like DOM reconciliation and state managementExpress the behavior of your code both within tests and via various forms of documentationWho this book is for This book is for anyone who writes JavaScript, professionally or otherwise. As this book does not relate specifically to any particular framework or environment, no prior experience of any JavaScript web framework is required. Some knowledge of programming is assumed to understand the concepts covered in the book more effectively.",

Martin Clean Code Collection consists of two bestselling eBooks: Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers In Clean Code, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer--but only if you work at it. You will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code and what’s wrong with it. More important, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. In The Clean Coder, Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice--about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. Readers of this collection will come away understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development What it means to behave as a true software craftsman How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers How to get into the flow of coding and get past writer’s block How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms How to manage your time and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive When to say “No”--and how to say it When to say “Yes”--and what yes really means",

What's the next step toward becoming a capable, confident software developer? Welcome to Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python. More than a mere collection of advanced syntax and masterful tips for writing clean code, you'll learn how to advance your Python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control. Sweigart takes you through best practices for setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability, then tackles documentation, organization and performance measurement, as well as object-oriented design and the Big-O algorithm analysis commonly used in coding interviews. The skills you learn will boost your ability to program--not just in Python but in any language. You'll learn: Coding style, and how to use Python's Black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code Common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers How to structure the files in your code projects with the Cookiecutter template tool Functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions How to profile the speed of your code with Python's built-in timeit and cProfile modules The computer science behind Big-O algorithm analysis How to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them How to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they're used to organize code Toward the end of the book you'll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the Tower of Hanoi (a logic puzzle) and Four-in-a-Row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book's best practices. You'll test your skills by implementing the program yourself. Of course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. But Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer, as you learn to write readable code that's easy to debug and perfectly Pythonic Requirements: Covers Python 3.6 and higher",

				"description": "Programmers who endure and succeed amidst swirling uncertainty and nonstop pressure share a common attribute: They care deeply about the practice of creating software. They treat it as a craft. They are professionals. In The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. Readers will learn What it means to behave as a true software craftsman How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writer’s block How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive When to say “No”–and how to say it When to say “Yes”–and what yes really means Great software is something to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer and as a user. Great software isn’t written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. The Clean Coder will help you become one of them–and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.",

				"publishedDate": "2023-03-24",
				"description": "This book is about the design and development of tools for software testing. It intends to get the reader involved in software testing rather than simply memorizing the concepts. The source codes are downloadable from the book website. The book has three parts: software testability, fault localization, and test data generation. Part I describes unit and acceptance tests and proposes a new method called testability-driven development (TsDD) in support of TDD and BDD. TsDD uses a machine learning model to measure testability before and after refactoring. The reader will learn how to develop the testability prediction model and write software tools for automatic refactoring. Part II focuses on developing tools for automatic fault localization. This part shows the reader how to use a compiler generator to instrument source code, create control flow graphs, identify prime paths, and slice the source code. On top of these tools, a software tool, Diagnoser, is offered to facilitate experimenting with and developing new fault localization algorithms. Diagnoser takes a source code and its test suite as input and reports the coverage provided by the test cases and the suspiciousness score for each statement. Part III proposes using software testing as a prominent part of the cyber-physical system software to uncover and model unknown physical behaviors and the underlying physical rules. The reader will get insights into developing software tools to generate white box test data.",

				"description": "h2> Kommentare, Formatierung, Strukturierung Fehler-Handling und Unit-Tests Zahlreiche Fallstudien, Best Practices, Heuristiken und Code Smells Clean Code - Refactoring, Patterns, Testen und Techniken für sauberen Code Aus dem Inhalt: Lernen Sie, guten Code von schlechtem zu unterscheiden Sauberen Code schreiben und schlechten Code in guten umwandeln Aussagekräftige Namen sowie gute Funktionen, Objekte und Klassen erstellen Code so formatieren, strukturieren und kommentieren, dass er bestmöglich lesbar ist Ein vollständiges Fehler-Handling implementieren, ohne die Logik des Codes zu verschleiern Unit-Tests schreiben und Ihren Code testgesteuert entwickeln Selbst schlechter Code kann funktionieren. Aber wenn der Code nicht sauber ist, kann er ein Entwicklungsunternehmen in die Knie zwingen. Jedes Jahr gehen unzählige Stunden und beträchtliche Ressourcen verloren, weil Code schlecht geschrieben ist. Aber das muss nicht sein. Mit Clean Code präsentiert Ihnen der bekannte Software-Experte Robert C. Martin ein revolutionäres Paradigma, mit dem er Ihnen aufzeigt, wie Sie guten Code schreiben und schlechten Code überarbeiten. Zusammen mit seinen Kollegen von Object Mentor destilliert er die besten Praktiken der agilen Entwicklung von sauberem Code zu einem einzigartigen Buch. So können Sie sich die Erfahrungswerte der Meister der Software-Entwicklung aneignen, die aus Ihnen einen besseren Programmierer machen werden – anhand konkreter Fallstudien, die im Buch detailliert durchgearbeitet werden. Sie werden in diesem Buch sehr viel Code lesen. Und Sie werden aufgefordert, darüber nachzudenken, was an diesem Code richtig und falsch ist. Noch wichtiger: Sie werden herausgefordert, Ihre professionellen Werte und Ihre Einstellung zu Ihrem Beruf zu überprüfen. Clean Code besteht aus drei Teilen:Der erste Teil beschreibt die Prinzipien, Patterns und Techniken, die zum Schreiben von sauberem Code benötigt werden. Der zweite Teil besteht aus mehreren, zunehmend komplexeren Fallstudien. An jeder Fallstudie wird aufgezeigt, wie Code gesäubert wird – wie eine mit Problemen behaftete Code-Basis in eine solide und effiziente Form umgewandelt wird. Der dritte Teil enthält den Ertrag und den Lohn der praktischen Arbeit: ein umfangreiches Kapitel mit Best Practices, Heuristiken und Code Smells, die bei der Erstellung der Fallstudien zusammengetragen wurden. Das Ergebnis ist eine Wissensbasis, die beschreibt, wie wir denken, wenn wir Code schreiben, lesen und säubern. Dieses Buch ist ein Muss für alle Entwickler, Software-Ingenieure, Projektmanager, Team-Leiter oder Systemanalytiker, die daran interessiert sind, besseren Code zu produzieren. Über den Autor: Robert C. »Uncle Bob« Martin entwickelt seit 1970 professionell Software. Seit 1990 arbeitet er international als Software-Berater. Er ist Gründer und Vorsitzender von Object Mentor, Inc., einem Team erfahrener Berater, die Kunden auf der ganzen Welt bei der Programmierung in und mit C++, Java, C#, Ruby, OO, Design Patterns, UML sowie Agilen Methoden und eXtreme Programming helfen.",

				"description": "We're losing tens of billions of dollars a year on broken software, and great new ideas such as agile development and Scrum don't always pay off. But there's hope. The nine software development practices in Beyond Legacy Code are designed to solve the problems facing our industry. Discover why these practices work, not just how they work, and dramatically increase the quality and maintainability of any software project. These nine practices could save the software industry. Beyond Legacy Code is filled with practical, hands-on advice and a common-sense exploration of why technical practices such as refactoring and test-first development are critical to building maintainable software. Discover how to avoid the pitfalls teams encounter when adopting these practices, and how to dramatically reduce the risk associated with building software--realizing significant savings in both the short and long term. With a deeper understanding of the principles behind the practices, you'll build software that's easier and less costly to maintain and extend. By adopting these nine key technical practices, you'll learn to say what, why, and for whom before how; build in small batches; integrate continuously; collaborate; create CLEAN code; write the test first; specify behaviors with tests; implement the design last; and refactor legacy code. Software developers will find hands-on, pragmatic advice for writing higher quality, more maintainable, and bug-free code. Managers, customers, and product owners will gain deeper insight into vital processes. By moving beyond the old-fashioned procedural thinking of the Industrial Revolution, and working together to embrace standards and practices that will advance software development, we can turn the legacy code crisis into a true Information Revolution.",

Its opinionated design and built-in concurrency features make it easy for engineers to author code that efficiently utilizes all available CPU cores. This Golang book distills industry best practices for writing lean Go code that is easy to test and maintain, and helps you to explore its practical implementation by creating a multi-tier application called Links ‘R’ Us from scratch. You’ll be guided through all the steps involved in designing, implementing, testing, deploying, and scaling an application. Starting with a monolithic architecture, you’ll iteratively transform the project into a service-oriented architecture (SOA) that supports the efficient out-of-core processing of large link graphs. You’ll learn about various cutting-edge and advanced software engineering techniques such as building extensible data processing pipelines, designing APIs using gRPC, and running distributed graph processing algorithms at scale. Finally, you’ll learn how to compile and package your Go services using Docker and automate their deployment to a Kubernetes cluster. By the end of this book, you’ll know how to think like a professional software developer or engineer and write lean and efficient Go code. What you will learnUnderstand different stages of the software development life cycle and the role of a software engineerCreate APIs using gRPC and leverage the middleware offered by the gRPC ecosystemDiscover various approaches to managing package dependencies for your projectsBuild an end-to-end project from scratch and explore different strategies for scaling itDevelop a graph processing system and extend it to run in a distributed mannerDeploy Go services on Kubernetes and monitor their health using PrometheusWho this book is for This Golang programming book is for developers and software engineers looking to use Go to design and build scalable distributed systems effectively.

This delightful book is part history, part personal stories, and all wisdom. If you want to understand what Agile is and how it came to be, this is the book for you.” –Grady Booch “Bob’s frustration colors every sentence of Clean Agile, but it’s a justified frustration. What is in the world of Agile development is nothing compared to what could be. This book is Bob’s perspective on what to focus on to get to that ‘what could be.’ And he’s been there, so it’s worth listening.” –Kent Beck “It’s good to read Uncle Bob’s take on Agile. Whether just beginning, or a seasoned Agilista, you would do well to read this book. I agree with almost all of it. It’s just some of the parts make me realize my own shortcomings, dammit. It made me double-check our code coverage (85.09%).” –Jon Kern Nearly twenty years after the Agile Manifesto was first presented, the legendary Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) reintroduces Agile values and principles for a new generation–programmers and nonprogrammers alike. Martin, author of Clean Code and other highly influential software development guides, was there at Agile’s founding. Now, in Clean Agile: Back to Basics, he strips away misunderstandings and distractions that over the years have made it harder to use Agile than was originally intended. Martin describes what Agile is in no uncertain terms: a small discipline that helps small teams manage small projects . . . with huge implications because every big project is comprised of many small projects. Drawing on his fifty years’ experience with projects of every conceivable type, he shows how Agile can help you bring true professionalism to software development. Get back to the basics–what Agile is, was, and should always be Understand the origins, and proper practice, of SCRUM Master essential business-facing Agile practices, from small releases and acceptance tests to whole-team communication Explore Agile team members’ relationships with each other, and with their product Rediscover indispensable Agile technical practices: TDD, refactoring, simple design, and pair programming Understand the central roles values and craftsmanship play in your Agile team’s success If you want Agile’s true benefits, there are no shortcuts: You need to do Agile right. Clean Agile: Back to Basics will show you how, whether you’re a developer, tester, manager, project manager, or customer.

Learning C++ effectively is more than a matter of simply reading through theory, as the real challenge is understanding the fundamentals in depth and being able to use them in the real world. If you're looking to learn C++ programming efficiently, this Workshop is a comprehensive guide that covers all the core features of C++ and how to apply them. It will help you take the next big step toward writing efficient, reliable C++ programs. The C++ Workshop begins by explaining the basic structure of a C++ application, showing you how to write and run your first program to understand data types, operators, variables and the flow of control structures. You'll also see how to make smarter decisions when it comes to using storage space by declaring dynamic variables during program runtime. Moving ahead, you'll use object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques such as inheritance, polymorphism, and class hierarchies to make your code structure organized and efficient. Finally, you'll use the C++ standard library?s built-in functions and templates to speed up different programming tasks. By the end of this C++ book, you will have the knowledge and skills to confidently tackle your own ambitious projects and advance your career as a C++ developer. What you will learnUnderstand how a C++ program is written, executed, and compiledEfficiently work with the essential C++ data types and variablesBuild your own C++ applications by writing clear and error-free codeGrasp the core principles behind object-oriented programmingSimplify your code by using templates and the standard libraryDebug logical errors and handle exceptions in your programWho this book is for This Workshop is for anyone who is new to C++ who wants to build a strong foundation for C++ game programming or application development.

Programmieren ist aber mehr als ein Handwerk. Klarer Code ist auch Ausdruck klaren Denkens und beginnt damit schon vor der Niederschrift. Regeln sind wichtige Stützen, aber das eigenständige Denken, Entscheiden und Abwägen ersetzen sie nicht. Leider wird darüber fast nie gesprochen. Das Buch soll helfen, dieses Manko zu beseitigen.

Fit for Developing Software shows you how to use Fit to clarify business rules, express them with concrete examples, and organize the examples into test tables that drive testing throughout the software lifecycle. Using a realistic case study, Rick Mugridge and Ward Cunningham--the creator of Fit--introduce each of Fit's underlying concepts and techniques, and explain how you can put Fit to work incrementally, with the lowest possible risk. Highlights include Integrating Fit into your development processes Using Fit to promote effective communication between businesspeople, testers, and developers Expressing business rules that define calculations, decisions, and business processes Connecting Fit tables to the system with \"fixtures\" that check whether tests are actually satisfied Constructing tests for code evolution, restructuring, and other changes to legacy systems Managing the quality and evolution of tests A companion Web site (http://fit.c2.com/) that offers additional resources and source code",

It is expected to serve both the current industry and those planning for the future. The work's coverage of the subject matter is the broadest to date, including not only the common topics of modeling and simulation, but also methods supporting the basis for the underlying assumptions, the extension to radiological safety, what to expect in a licensing review, historical perspectives and the implication for new designs.This text is an essential resource for practitioners and students, on the current best-practices in nuclear power plant safety and their basis. Contributors of this work are subject matter experts in their specialties, much of which was nurtured and inspired by Prof. Larry Hochreiter, a prominent nuclear safety pioneer.Related Link(s)",

				"description": "No concorrido mundo da tecnologia, melhorias de milissegundos em performance podem fazer toda a diferença para seus clientes. Dessa necessidade, surgiram diversos paradigmas e frameworks, exigindo paralelamente um bom e rápido desempenho na persistência da informação. Neste cenário nasceu o Apache Cassandra, o banco de dados NoSQL, elástico, tolerante a falhas e com um alto grau de performance. O Cassandra é um banco de dados não relacional originado pelo Facebook, e hoje é um projeto open source dentro da Apache Foundation com cases de sucessos nas maiores empresas do mundo, como o Netflix, GitHub, eBay, dentre outros. Neste livro, Otávio Santana aborda o Cassandra, seus conceitos e sua aplicabilidade com o Java. Após uma introdução aos bancos de dados não relacionais, você verá conceitos como a hierarquia, leitura e escrita, seu funcionamento no nó e sua orquestração dentro de um Cluster. Será apresentado o funcionamento prático da linguagem de comunicação Cassandra Query Language ou CQL, com dicas de modelagem e frameworks de mapeamento, dentre os quais o DataStax Mapper, Spring Data Cassandra, Hibernate OGM Cassandra e o Eclipse JNoSQL.",
